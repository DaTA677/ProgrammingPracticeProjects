# Practice projects:

Project in C++ to learn and understand concepts. Build using CMAKE for
Visual Studio projects.

# constProject:

Contains [main.cpp](/constProject/main.cpp) file that showcases the use of keyword "const" in
different scenarios like:

-   Const variable

-   Const pointer to normal variable

-   Pointer to const variable

-   Const pointer to const variable

PracticeClass is used to showcase use of keyword "const" in scenarios
involving functions and class member variables:

-   Const member variable initialization

-   Const function

-   Const function overloading

-   Const input to functions

-   Const return type

## stringProject

Project to showcase following operations done on strings in C++ [here](/stringProject/PracticeClass.cpp):

-   ReverseString

-   EncodeString

-   PalindromeCheck(both case-sensitive and case-insensitive)

## vectorProject

Project to showcase various operations done on vectors in C++ like [here](/vectorProject/PracticeClass.cpp) :

-   Reversing a vector

-   Checking if a string of brackets are balanced

-   Insertion Sort

## Sorting and SortingTesting

Projects to showcase different sorting algorithms

-   [Sorting.h](/Sorting/Sorting.h) -\> Base class

-   [BubbleSorting](/Sorting/BubbleSorting.cpp) -\> Sorts using bubble sort

-   [InsertionSort](/Sorting/InsertionSort.cpp) -\> Sorts using insertion sort

-   [MergeSort](/Sorting/MergeSort.h) -\> abstract base class for merge sort . --TO DO in-place merge
    sort---

-   [OutPlaceMergeSort](/Sorting/OutPlaceMergeSort.cpp) -\> sorts using temp arrays for merge sort

-   [OptimisedBubbleSort](/Sorting/OptimisedBubbleSort) -\> Sorts using bubble sort with a check for
    sorted list at each iteration

SortingTesting contains [Main.cpp](/SortingTesting/Main.cpp) which shows how to invoke the sorting
functions and also time-comparison between the different algorithms
based on the array size.
